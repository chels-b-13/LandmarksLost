description: "It’s the age old mystery–if walls could talk, what would they say? Luckily, I got Chris Bateman, Manager of the Plaques program at Heritage Toronto to talk instead. In this podcast, we take a look at one of the oldest buildings in Toronto still in operational use; the St. Lawrence Hall. Discussion around heritage restoration, specific features of the building, as well as future plans for the St. Lawrence Market area take centre stage in this episode."
