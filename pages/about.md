## Description

It’s the age old mystery–if walls could talk, what would they say? Luckily, I got Chris Bateman, Manager of the Plaques program at Heritage Toronto to talk instead. In this podcast, we take a look at one of the oldest buildings in Toronto still in operational use; the St. Lawrence Hall. Discussion around heritage restoration, specific features of the building, as well as future plans for the St. Lawrence Market area take centre stage in this episode.

## Acknowledgments

The St. Lawrence Hall is located on the traditional territories of the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and in present-day Tkaronto, at 157 King Street East at the southwest corner of King and Jarvis. The land that would become the St. Lawrence Hall and Market was part of the Toronto Purchase in 1787 by the British who ‘bought’ land claimed by the Mississaugas. I acknowledge its situation on traditional territories not only out of due respect, but because of the history of the site’s heritage designation as part of Canada’s Centennial celebrations, an event intended to consolidate the colonial nation project.

I would like to extend my thanks to Chris Bateman for volunteering his time to speak with me and for whom this podcast could not have been possible without.
